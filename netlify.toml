  # Enable automatic dependency cache

  # Netlify automatically caches node_modules and .pnpm-store

  # Enable pnpm
  # Netlify automatically detects pnpm from package.json's packageManager field
  # But we can explicitly enable it here for clarity
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"  # This ensures pnpm is used instead of npm

# Redirect rules

# Trailing slash handling (matches astro.config.mjs setting of "ignore")
# Astro handles this internally, but you can add custom redirects here if needed
